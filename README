INSTALLATION

I developed this software on a machine running Ubuntu Linux, but it should work on
any system that has Ruby and libusb. If you want to use the GUI code I wrote, you'll
also need the GTK2 library for Ruby. On an Ubuntu machine, the following commands will
install all the libraries you need:
  sudo apt-get install libusb-dev ruby-gtk2 ruby-json ruby1.9.1-dev
  sudo gem sources -a  http://rubygems.org
  sudo gem install ruby-usb
Now install the software by doing:
  make install

USE FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Examples:
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.dt.join(" "); l.reset'
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.pendulum.join(" "); l.reset'
The first example collects data from a photogate for 10 seconds, and prints out a list of the lengths of time
for which it was blocked. The second one does something similar in pendulum mode. If these cause an error
"Operation not permitted," then see below under Permissions.

Checking for errors:
   p.exceptions.each {|e| raise e,e.message if e.severity=="error"};

Analog sensors:
   f=AnalogSensor.new(l,"force"); print f.options["range"],"\n",f.get_data,"\n"; l.reset

GUI

The sample program in the file "photogate" collects data from a photogate, printing out the time for which
it is blocked. You can run it using the command "ruby photogate".

The sample program in the file "force" will continuously read out a force probe, which
must be set to the 10 N scale.

If these cause an error "Operation not permitted," then see below under Permissions.

SENSORS SUPPORTED

So far only photogates and dual-range force sensors are working. Motion sensors are detected but can't be
read out.

PERMISSIONS

If you get "Operation not permitted" errors, the only workaround I've found is to add the following
lines to your sudoers file, using visudo:
  ALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/labpro/photogate
  ALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/labpro/force
Then when you run the program, do, e.g., "sudo photogate" rather than just "photogate".

BUGS

The force probe program doesn't work properly with four force probes connected.

Vernier.rb crashes when the LabPro is powered off.
